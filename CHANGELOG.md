## Version 1.1.5
* CCT auto scaling missing templates fixed so creatures will have the correct level and death items.
* Handle the shaw gang

## Version 1.1.4
* Clean up bug causing empty user log files to be created

## Version 1.1.3
* Mini bosses are hard set back to 10% growth. Stupid me put the scaling factor there which cna be up to 6 times scaling. Sorry about that. 

## Version 1.1.2
* Now using user debug logs via Venpi Core v1.0.10

## Version 1.1.1
* Oops forgot the random dice roll on the loot injection 

## Version 1.1.0
* There is no race customization, now there are just 5 presets (Story, Easy, Normal, Hard, Nightmare, and Apocalypse)
* Mob types are back but controlled by random chance and difficulty level (See sticky)
* Restored contraband loot for pirates (Spacers and Crimson Fleet) and Va'Ruun with a very rare chance (10%) to get 1-2 items.
* Eventually the mini bosses will have an animation effect and special skills but that is still in the planning phase. Not messing with the leveled NPC lists and just the encounter NPCs makes this much harder.

## Version 1.0.2
* Removed attack/crit multipliers for now. When used with other mods (Peak, Scarfield, Better Enemy Weapons, etc) they cause way too much damage scaling. Will readd when I can figure out a way to use weapon damage.

## Version 1.0.1
* Stupid typo was preventing script from binding to NPCs.
* Compatible with Peak Enemy AI now

## Version 1.0.0
* Initial Release
