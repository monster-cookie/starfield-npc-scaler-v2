# V1.0 Permutations

## V1.0.2
* Removed attack/crit multipliers for now. When used with other mods (Peak, Scarfield, Better Enemy Weapons, etc) they cause way too much damage scaling. Will readd when I can figure out a way to use weapon damage.

## V1.0.1
* Stupid typo was preventing script from binding to NPCs.
* Compatible with Peak Enemy AI now

## V1.0.0
* Initial Release
