# Scale The World

## Version 1.1.11
* Compatibility with Venworks Faction Overhaul v2.0.6 or newer. Factions is now a required mod. 
* Moved game settings to RTFP like I did with Factions. RTFP is now an optional requirement. 
* As we found out with factions screwing with aggression settings breaks quests so reverting that in the encounter NPC records.
