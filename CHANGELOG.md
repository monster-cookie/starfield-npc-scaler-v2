# Scale The World

## Version 3.0.0
* Converting to SFCK and Xbox compatibility
* Also used latest CK compatible Spriggit for the conversion form xedit and to merge in the parts of MCS we need. This is highly experimental.
* Using a stripped down internal copy of Modular NPC Creation System (MCS)

NOTE: Do not upgrade if an existing user this will require a new game though a new NGP universe MIGHT work.
